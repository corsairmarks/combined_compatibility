[b][i]DEPRECATED:[/i][/b] As of the 3.4 "Cepheus" versions of Stellaris, there are no conflicts between "Subtle Polish: A Collection of Fixes and Enhancements" and "Silfae's Portraits: Revisited." Do not use this mod.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
This mod is a compatibility patch between my two major compilation mods [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2522974089]Subtle Polish: A Collection of Fixes and Enhancements[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2596417938]Silfae's Portraits: Revisited[/url].  Both of them make changes to the same Pop jobs files, and thus need a patch so that their changes are applied concurrently.

As of Stellaris version 3.3 "Libra," this mod has drastically shrunk in size.  The only remaining conflicts are 4 miner-related jobs.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Overwrites four jobs, which are also overwritten in each of the source mods, in order to make their changes work together:
[list]
[*]miner
[*]scrap_miner
[*]cave_cleaner
[*]turtle_miner
[/list]
[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Only use this mod if you are using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2522974089]Subtle Polish: A Collection of Fixes and Enhancements[/url] and/or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2596417938]Silfae's Portraits: Revisited[/url].  Because the only conflicts are between the packed mods [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2510669821]"Agrarian" Idyll for Lithoids[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2592592503]Animated Holosphere Portraits: Revisited[/url], this mod can be used a a compatibility patch between both collection mods, one of the collection mods and the conflicting single mod, or between just the two conflicting single mods.

Built for Stellaris version 3.3 "Libra."  Not compatible with achievements.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
Overriding a job causes the game to log errors. Expect to see four lines in the error.log file similar to these:
