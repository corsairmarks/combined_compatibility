[h1]Overview[/h1]

This mod is a compatibility patch between my two major compilation mods [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2522974089]Subtle Polish: A Collection of Fixes and Enhancements[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2596417938]Silfae's Portraits: Revisited[/url].  Both of them make changes to the same Pop jobs files, and thus need a patch so that all the changes are applied concurrently.

[h1]Changes[/h1]

Overwrites two game files, which are also overwritten in each of the source mods, in order to make their changes work together:

[list]
[*][b]common/pop_jobs/03_worker_jobs.txt[/b]
[*][b]common/pop_jobs/06_event_jobs.txt[/b]
[/list]
